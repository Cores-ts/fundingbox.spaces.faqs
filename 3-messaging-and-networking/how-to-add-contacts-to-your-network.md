### **Why would you want to add a contact to your network?**



On the FundingBox Platform, you can by default start a conversation with any other user. Hence, connecting with other users is not necessarily a must to start networking.
However, some users, including yourself may decide in their *Data & Privacy* settings to restrict messaging possibilities with contacts only. In this case, it is only by adding these users to your network that you will be able to chat with them.
