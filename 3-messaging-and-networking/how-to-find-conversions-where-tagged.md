### **Why would you want to find the conversations in which you were tagged?**



Many times, because you have turned off your notifications or maybe simply because you are away, you would not be able to know whether a user started chatting with you, requested your help, etc. through the platform.
There is one simple way to find without going through the whole chat history of all your contacts and communities.

1. Click on the *@* button on the left-side menu panel.
2. A window will open, containing all your latest mentions. Scroll down to see all the conversations you were tagged in.
3. For each listed conversation, you have a *View or start a thread* button on which you can click to reply to the user that tagged you.
