Follow the steps below to create a custom role for your community members. 

* First, you need to create the new role:
  1. Open the *Community settings* page in a community for which you are an administrator. You can access it by clicking on *"gear"* icon at the top right of your screen of your chosen community and selecting *Manage this Community* from the dropdown.
  2. On the *Community settings* page, scroll down and click on *Roles* in the left-hand menu.
  3. Under *Create a role*, enter your chosen Role name and select which parent roleâ€™s permissions you would like this new role to inherit (optional), then click on *Create* to record your new role.

* Next you need to assign the new role to one or more of your community spaces:
  4. Select *Community Spaces* in the left-hand side menu.
  5. Click the *Edit* button next to your chosen space and on the next screen click on *Edit the space details*.
  6. Under *Restrict publishing to these roles*, select the new role you created. You can select multiple roles for this space.
  7. Click on *Save changes* when you are done selecting roles. Repeat steps 5, 6, 7 for each space in which you wish to assign the new role.
