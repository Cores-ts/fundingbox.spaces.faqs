NB: Please note that this option will completely remove all your user data from our database and that this action is permanent and can't be reverted. To completely remove your data, FundingBox needs permission from the other data operators or partners within its platform, if you have data shared with them. If you have joined a community on our platform or accepted to share your data with third parties through our platform, a list of these communities and third parties will be displayed on your screen. Click the button below this table labeled “Send a notification to all partners and flag my account for removal” to delete your account and all your data from our servers.
