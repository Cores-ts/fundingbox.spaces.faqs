title: What is the FundingBox Platform?
---

FundingBoxâ€™s main belief is that relationships are the foundations of any business. 
Organisations in the field of funding (accelerators, corporates, venture capitalists, angel investors, event organisers, EU projects coordinators, regional and national public institutions, Digital Innovation Hubs, etc.) need to interact with each other but they do not necessarily have the right tools to make the most out of these interactions and find the perfect match.
FundingBox is a dynamic and interactive web platform for deep tech innovators in the quest for funding, investors and corporates hunting for the next unicorn and any stakeholder part of the funding process.

The FundingBox platform relies on an ecosystem of Deep Tech communities that are related to specific industries:
Smart Mobility
Robotics
Decentralised Technologies
Circular Economy
Next Generation Internet
Industry 4.0
Etc.
35,000 subscribers including stakeholders from startups, SMEs, Research & Technology Centres and a variety of other organisations join relevant communities and shape the destiny of others in a brighter way by sharing experiences, promoting funding opportunities and triggering exponential growth.
