How to sign out from other sessions

Click on your profile picture on the top-left part of the page and then click on Manage my account. 
Go to the Security section.
Scroll down and click on Sign out from other sessions. This will sign you out from all sessions whether there on mobile or desktop devices. This way you will avoid any ill-intentioned person to access your account through other devices.
